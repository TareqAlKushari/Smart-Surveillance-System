# Smart Surveillance System

The **Smart Surveillance System** is an advanced security solution designed to enhance public safety and prevent criminal activities such as shoplifting and arson. This project integrates multiple AI models for robust, real-time surveillance and incident detection.

## Features

- **Face Recognition**: Utilizes BlazeFace and ResNet50Face models for accurate and efficient facial identification.
- **Shoplifting Detection**: Employs advanced AI to identify suspicious behavior and potential shoplifting incidents.
- **Arson Recognition**: Detects arson attempts and fire hazards using LRCN (Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks).
- **Multi-Model Integration**: Seamlessly combines different AI models for comprehensive surveillance.
- **Python-based Implementation**: Easy to extend or modify for different surveillance scenarios.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **AI Models:**
  - BlazeFace
  - ResNet50Face
  - LRCN
- **Computer Vision & Deep Learning Frameworks:** [Specify frameworks, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.]

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TareqAlKushari/Smart-Surveillance-System.git
   cd Smart-Surveillance-System
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Install required packages (see `requirements.txt` if available):
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Prepare the models:**
   - Download or train the necessary AI models as described in the documentation or code comments.

4. **Run the system:**
   - Start the surveillance system with:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - (Adjust filename/entry point if different.)

## Usage

- Configure camera sources and detection parameters in the configuration files.
- View real-time alerts and logs for detected incidents.
- Extend detection capabilities by integrating additional AI models.
