# Smart Surveillance System
The Smart Surveillance System is an advanced security solution designed to enhance public safety and prevent criminal activities such as shoplifting and arson. This project integrates multiple AI models, including face recognition, shoplifting recognition, and arson recognition, into a unified system capable of real-time monitoring and threat detection. The face recognition module utilizes BlazeFace for face detection and ResNet50Face for face recognition, which is implemented using the PaddlePaddle framework. For event detection, the system employs Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCN) on TensorFlow to analyze video sequences and identify shoplifting and arson events. These models are developed as video action recognition systems, processing sequences of frames to detect temporal patterns and ensure accurate event detection.  

The system features a user-friendly interface built with PyQt, allowing users to manage multiple cameras, view live feeds, and receive real-time alerts. The interface is designed to be intuitive and scalable, catering to both small-scale and large-scale deployments.  

The project was rigorously tested, achieving high accuracy in face recognition and event detection, with minimal latency for real-time processing. The Smart Surveillance System demonstrates the potential of AI-driven solutions in modern security applications, offering a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly platform for preventing and mitigating criminal activities. This project lays the foundation for future advancements in intelligent surveillance systems.
